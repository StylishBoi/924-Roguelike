# 924-Roguelike
SAE - 924 Maximilien - Module 3

---Essentials---

THE GAME DOES NOT WORK ON CONTROLLER, YOU WILL HAVE TO PLAY IT WITH MOUSE AND KEYBOARD

The instructions for the game and how to play can be found directly within the game on the main menu.
I would recommend to create a build to play to avoid having the gizmos drawings while playing.
If you are not going to use a build, please start on the main menu, the instructions to access is just under here.

---Scenes---

They can be found in the assets file, under "02_Scenes".

"Main Menu" - Where the game starts off

"DungeonGeneration" - Where the main game happens

"End Screen" - Where you can see your score after the game
